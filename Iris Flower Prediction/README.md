Task 1 – Iris Dataset Analysis

DevelopersHub Corporation – Data Science & Analytics Internship

📌 Task Objective

The objective of this task is to explore, understand, and visualize the Iris dataset using Python.
This includes analyzing the dataset structure, identifying patterns, and using visualizations to understand relationships between different flower measurements.

📊 Dataset

The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers with the following features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

The dataset was loaded using the Seaborn library.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

🧠 Approach

Loaded the Iris dataset using Seaborn

Explored the dataset using .head(), .shape(), .columns(), .info(), and .describe()

Checked for missing values and confirmed the data was clean

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using:

Scatter plots

Histograms

Box plots

Trained a Logistic Regression model to classify flower species

Evaluated the model using accuracy and confusion matrix

📈 Results & Insights

Petal length and petal width are the most important features for identifying flower species

The Logistic Regression model achieved high accuracy, showing that the dataset is highly separable

Visualizations clearly showed differences between Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica

✅ Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrated data loading, data exploration, visualization, and basic machine learning.
It provided valuable insights into how flower species can be classified based on physical measurements.
